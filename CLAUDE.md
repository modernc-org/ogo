# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

OctoGo is a special-purpose, Go-inspired programming language and its compiler,
targeting the Parallax Propeller 2 (P2) 8-core microcontroller. The compiler is a
source-to-source transpiler written in Go: it parses a strict LL(1) subset of a
Go-like language, statically checks it against the P2's zero-allocation/no-GC
hardware model, and emits C that is compiled to a P2 binary by an in-process,
transpiled copy of the flexspin/flexcc C compiler.

This is early-stage work in progress, but the whole pipeline is connected: the
frontend (scanner, parser, formatter), the checker, C emission and the backend
all work, and `ogo build` produces a P2 binary while `ogo run` loads it onto a
board. What is missing is breadth, not a stage -- see **Implementation status**.

## Language feature policy (read before assuming something is excluded)

**The goal is to support what pre-generics Go supports, wherever that is feasible
on the target.** A construct that does not work is therefore *work not yet done*,
not a decision taken -- unless it is one of the hardware-rooted exceptions below.

This distinction matters because it is easy to get backwards. The grammar was
frozen early to reach a proof of concept, and the notes written then ("OctoGo does
not support X") have been read since as design decisions when they were only
status. Floats, the sized integer types, `&&`/`||`, three-clause and range `for`,
labels, and multi-package programs were all once "not supported" and are now in
the language. **Before treating any such note as settled, check whether the
feature actually works** -- and if a stale note is found, fix the note.

The deliberate exceptions, all rooted in the Propeller 2 hardware:

- **No heap.** Nothing allocates at run time. This is what rules out `new`, every
  `make` form but the slice one, maps, runtime string concatenation, and a
  function literal that captures its surrounding scope.
- **A goroutine is a physical cog** (there are eight). No scheduler, no
  preemption; `go` starts a real core, not a task.
- **A channel is a P2 hardware lock** over statically allocated Hub RAM -- a
  synchronous rendezvous with no scheduler behind it.
- **An interface value holds a POINTER**, and only a pointer: `var s Shape = &q`,
  never `= q`. Shipped 2026-08-03 -- a data pointer beside a pointer to a statically
  emitted vtable, one table per (concrete type, interface) pair, with type
  assertions and type switches on top. Go copies the value in and allocates for it;
  there is no heap here, so the value form is refused rather than made a silently
  aliasing reference. That is what keeps "a program that compiles here means what it
  means in Go". Devirtualization is the piece still open. See
  `internal/octogo/octogo.go`.

**Generics are a separate category: not supported, not planned, not ruled out.**
A question for after v1 -- whether an LL(1) grammar can describe them at all,
whether they earn their complexity on a microcontroller, and how they meet the
whole-program specialization the compiler already intends. Do not build toward
them, and do not design them out.

`specs.go`'s "Relationship to Go" section states the same policy for language
users; keep the two in step.

## Module path vs. directory (important)

- Repo directory on disk: `modernc.org/ogo`
- `go.mod` module path: `modernc.org/ogo`
- Installed binary / CLI command: `ogo` (`go install modernc.org/ogo@latest`)
- Internal packages import as `modernc.org/ogo/internal/...`

The package name inside `internal/octogo` is `octogo` while the module is `ogo`;
that mismatch is deliberate and is the only one left. The stale `// import "..."`
comments that used to contradict all of this have been removed.

The canonical repository is GitLab (`cznic/ogo`); GitHub (`modernc-org/ogo`) is a
mirror that accepts issues/PRs which are then manually merged upstream.

## Commands

```sh
go build ./...              # build everything
go install                 # build + install the `ogo` CLI onto PATH
go test ./...              # fast test of all packages
make test                  # full suite: gofmt, go install, `ogo fmt`, then go test -timeout 24h -count=1 -failfast ./...
make -C internal/octogo race   # go test -race + golint + staticcheck for the compiler core
gofmt -l -s -w .           # canonical Go formatting (CI enforces this)
```

Running one semantic-check spec test (files live in `internal/octogo/testdata/*.ogo`):

```sh
go test ./internal/octogo/ -run 'TestOctoGoSpecs/05_scope_shadowing.ogo' -v
go test ./internal/octogo/ -re '05_' -run TestOctoGoSpecs -v   # -re is a custom flag filtering which .ogo files run
```

CLI subcommands (`ogo <cmd>`): `build`, `run`, `test`, `fmt`, `loadp2`, `smith`,
`help` and `version` all work. There is no stub left.

```sh
ogo fmt -l -w --exclude='\/testdata\/' .   # gofmt-style reformat of .ogo sources in place
ogo smith -seed 12345                      # emit a random OctoGo program to stdout (compiler fuzzer)
```

## Code generation

Three generated artifacts are checked in. Regenerate only when changing their
inputs, and never hand-edit the outputs.

1. **Grammar → parser.** `internal/octogo/parser.go` (marked `DO NOT EDIT`) is
   produced by [`modernc.org/egg`](https://gitlab.com/cznic/egg) from
   `internal/octogo/octogo.ebnf`, which is in turn *extracted from the package
   doc comment of `specs.go`* (root). The grammar is authored as `//\t`-prefixed,
   ` .`-terminated EBNF lines inside that doc comment. **To change the language
   syntax, edit `specs.go`'s doc comment**, then:
   ```sh
   go install modernc.org/egg@latest
   make -C internal/octogo parser.go   # extract_grammar.go -> octogo.ebnf -> egg -> parser.go (+ sed cleanup)
   ```
   Note: the grammar is intentionally looser than the language — it accepts more
   than is legal, and the semantic checker narrows it down.

2. **Stringers.** `internal/octogo/stringer.go` (`stringer -type Kind,ScopeKind,gate`),
   regenerated by `make -C internal/octogo editor`.

3. **flexcc backend.** `internal/flexcc/ccgo_<goos>_<goarch>.go` (~12 MB, ~455k
   lines each) is the flexspin/flexcc C compiler transpiled to Go by
   `modernc.org/ccgo`. Five targets are committed — `ccgo_linux_amd64.go`,
   `ccgo_linux_arm64.go`, `ccgo_windows_amd64.go`, `ccgo_darwin_arm64.go` and
   `ccgo_darwin_amd64.go` — plus `ccgo.go` and `ccgo_g_*.go`, the shared decls
   `undup` (`modernc.org/undup`) folds out of them under shared build tags. The
   same-ABI LP64 linux amd64+arm64 pair now shares a lot (like loadp2's ~2x),
   while the LLP64 windows and the darwin transpiles share little cross-ABI. Do not
   hand-edit any of them. `internal/generator.go`
   (build-tagged `//go:build
   ignore`) drives both: it clones `totalspectrum/flexprop` (pinned to tag
   **`v7.7.0`** via the `flexpropRef` constant), applies `internal/mcpp_main.c.diff`,
   transpiles, and rewrites the emitted `main` package into a reusable `flexcc`
   library (threading a `*CC` state struct through the C globals, via `main2lib`).
   The linux backend is transpiled natively (`ccgo -exec make`, `transpileLinux`);
   the windows backend is cross-compiled on a linux/amd64 host with MinGW
   (`transpileWindows`: a native `make` to produce the bison/xxd-generated C sources,
   then a direct `ccgo --goos windows --goarch amd64 --cpp x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`
   pass over the explicit flexcc source list). The two darwin backends are generated
   natively on a darwin host (`transpileDarwin`, same native-make-then-direct-ccgo
   shape as windows but with `--cpp clang`): darwin/arm64 directly, darwin/amd64 on
   an arm64 mac under Rosetta 2 (the amd64 go+ccgo toolchain via `arch -x86_64`; the
   generator uses the homebrew `gmake`/`gsed` since macOS ships BSD make/sed).
   transpileDarwin shadows `<mach-o/dyld.h>` with a one-symbol shim (its real form
   drags in `<mach/message.h>`, which `modernc.org/cc` cannot size) and passes
   `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0` (macOS defaults it to 2, emitting `__builtin___*_chk`
   fortify calls ccgo cannot resolve). The linux run also emits two sibling
   artifacts that keep the in-repo compiler self-contained (the windows run reuses
   them, being target-independent): `internal/flexcc/p2include.tar.gz` — the installed
   flexprop P2 include/lib tree (headers, libc sources, `libc.a`) packed as a
   deterministic gzip'd tar, `go:embed`ed by `flexcc/p2include.go` and extracted at
   runtime so `flexcc.Main` needs no external flexprop install — and
   `internal/flexcc/LICENSE-flexprop` for attribution. Regeneration is `cd internal &&
   go generate` (or `go run generator.go`) on a linux host of the target
   architecture — linux/amd64 or linux/arm64, native either way (`ccgo -exec make`,
   no ccgo CLI needed); `cd internal && TARGET_GOOS=windows TARGET_GOARCH=amd64
   go run generator.go` (windows, needs `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` and the `ccgo` CLI
   on PATH); or `cd internal && go run generator.go` on a darwin host for
   darwin/arm64 and `arch -x86_64 <amd64-go> run generator.go` (with an amd64 `ccgo`
   on PATH) for darwin/amd64 — heavy and network-dependent; to adopt a changed
   `flexpropRef` you must `rm -rf internal/flexprop` first so the pin is re-cloned.
   Generating a second target after a first (without resetting between) accumulates
   both into the fold; e.g. run darwin/amd64 after darwin/arm64 on the mac.
   The generator handles the `undup` fold itself so the steps can't be run out of
   order: it `undup.Expand`s the prior fold to full per-target files, regenerates this
   target, `gofmt -s`s so the shared decls are byte-canonical across targets, then
   `undup.Dedup`s to re-fold (`modernc.org/undup/lib`, pinned via go.mod's `tool
   modernc.org/undup` directive so `go mod tidy` keeps it despite the import living
   only in the `//go:build ignore` generator). No manual expand/gofmt/dedup needed.
   The windows backend also needs two hand-written companions:
   `internal/flexcc/supplement_windows_amd64.go` (the CRT/Win32 functions
   `modernc.org/libc` lacks or stubs for windows) and `freopen_notwindows.go` (the
   linux/other-unix counterpart, tagged `!windows && !darwin`); see the windows note
   below. Darwin has its own `internal/flexcc/supplement_darwin.go` (the libc
   functions — `stpcpy`, `wcrtomb`, `asctime`, `fseeko`/`ftello`, `powl`/`frexpl`,
   `freopen`, and the `ungetc`/`abort` todo-stub redirects — that libc lacks or
   stubs for both darwin arches).

## Architecture

`main.go` is a thin CLI dispatcher (arg parsing via `modernc.org/opt`) that routes
subcommands to `internal/*` packages.

- **`internal/octogo`** — the compiler core. `Build()` in `build.go` orchestrates a
  concurrent, multi-phase pipeline over a package's `.ogo` files, coordinated by a
  `BuildContext` that resolves imports and detects import cycles (namespaces are
  implicit from directory name; there is no `package` keyword). The intended
  phase structure — parallel local-scope population, serial package-scope merge,
  serial top-level type/const evaluation (with a `gate` state machine for cycle
  detection), parallel body checking of hardware constraints, then a serial deep
  init-cycle pass — is documented in detail in the package doc comment of
  `octogo.go`, which also specifies the later Whole-Program-Optimization /
  monomorphization / devirtualization design.

  The **AST is a flat `[]int32` slice** (zero pointers, cache-local), not a tree
  of node structs. Traverse it with the `it(ast []int32) iter.Seq[Node]` iterator
  (Go 1.23+ range-over-func); each `Node` carries a `sym Symbol` for non-terminals
  or a `tok` for terminals. Tokens are named `TOK_<keyword>` or `TOK_<hex-of-rune>`
  (e.g. `TOK_003b` is `;`); readable aliases (`ARROW`, `SEMICOLON`, `IDENT`, …)
  are defined at the top of `scanner.go`. Key files: `scanner.go` (lexer with
  Go-style automatic semicolon insertion), `check.go` (semantic analysis, the
  largest file), `decl.go`/`type.go`/`value.go`/`const.go` (declarations, the type
  and value model), `format.go` (the `.ogo` pretty-printer behind `ogo fmt`).

- **`internal/format`** — thin `ogo fmt` subcommand wrapper: walks paths, runs
  files through `octogo.FormatFile` concurrently, handles `-l`/`-w`/`-exclude`.

- **`internal/smith`** (package `octosmith`) — the `ogo smith` fuzzer. It is an
  *oracle fuzzer*: it interprets the program as it generates it, so it knows the
  expected final state and emits a self-checking checksum assertion into the
  output. A compiled binary that fails the assertion implicates the compiler/backend
  with zero false positives. `gemini.go` drives type-directed generation over the
  LL(1) grammar; `vm.go`/`vmapi.go`/`env.go`/`types.go` are the generation-time VM
  (scope, memory, arithmetic). Design notes in `OctoSmith Fuzzer Architecture Document.md`.

- **`internal/flexcc`** — the C backend as a library. `flexcc.go`'s `Main()` runs
  the transpiled compiler in-process over a `libc.TLS`, capturing stdout/stderr
  into Go writers. Not yet wired into `ogo build`; currently only exercised
  standalone (see `all_test.go`'s `--help` golden test).

Data flow: `.ogo` sources → scanner/parser (`internal/octogo`) → flat AST →
semantic checks → emitted C → `internal/flexcc` → P2 binary → `internal/loadp2` →
board. That whole path runs today (`ogo build`, `ogo run`); WPO is the one stage
still design-only.

## Implementation status (where the TODOs are)

- `Build()` runs phases 1–3 fully; phases 4 (body/hardware checks) and 5 (deep
  init cycles) are **partial**, not stubs (`internal/octogo/build.go`): phase 4
  walks bodies to declare parameters and locals (reporting redeclarations) and to
  descend into nested blocks, but has no statement type-checking or
  hardware-constraint checks yet; phase 5 reports value-recursive (infinite-size)
  types but not global initialization-order cycles. WPO is design-only. C emission
  is **not** a stub -- `internal/octogo/emit.go` is the largest single piece of the
  compiler and is wired through `internal/build` to flexcc and loadp2.
- `TestOctoGoSpecs` (`internal/octogo/tests_test.go`) runs every `*.ogo` file in
  `internal/octogo/testdata` — there is no skip list (the historical one was
  retired as the checker caught up). Each file is annotated `// COMPILE` or
  `// ERROR <regexp>`; all currently pass, but the checker is still partial, so a
  green spec is not proof a whole feature is finished — the testdata covers only
  what has been wired up.
- `ogo test` runs a package's `*_test.ogo` tests **on the board** and nowhere else:
  it builds them with a generated runner, loads the result, and reads the verdict
  back over the serial line (the P2 returns no exit status). `-c` builds without
  running, which is what CI with no board can honestly do. A host mode was
  considered and rejected -- see `internal/build/test.go`.
  The `testing` package is EMBEDDED SOURCE, not an intrinsic: `embeddedPkgs` in
  `internal/octogo/build.go` maps the import path to ordinary OctoGo that is
  compiled and mangled like any other package. The day it ships on disk, the only
  change is where it is read from.
- **Interfaces are done and devirtualization is not.** A method call through an
  interface is an indirect call through a static vtable, always; the WPO pass that
  would make it direct where the concrete type is provable is design-only. Nothing
  is rejected for failing to prove one -- rejection is spent on lifetime.
- **Method values bind their receiver at compile time**, which is why they cost
  nothing that other function values pay. Go's representation (a value pointing at a
  struct whose first word is the code pointer) was measured on hardware and declined:
  `doc/funcval-cost.c` has the numbers, the attribution and how to revisit it. Do not
  re-open that without re-reading it.
- Composite literals cover positional and keyed structs (`P{1, 2}`, `P{x: 1}`),
  positional array/slice literals (`[3]int{1, 2, 3}`, `[]int{1, 2, 3}`), and
  indexed array/slice literals (`[]int{2: 5}`, `[5]int{0: 1, 4: 9}`, mixed
  `[]int{1, 4: 9}`) with constant indices -- expanded to positional C initializers
  (gaps zero-filled), a slice's length being the highest index plus one. A
  non-constant index is refused.
- Multi-package programs work: a user `import "geo"` resolves to a sibling
  directory and the whole program -- the main package plus every package it
  imports, transitively -- is emitted into **one C translation unit** in dependency
  order, with top-level symbols mangled into their package's namespace. `import
  "p2"` remains the one dotless, directory-less import, mapping to the hardware
  intrinsics. There is no standard library.
- **Two test suites.** `TestEmitCRun` builds each program in the `emitRunCases`
  table with the host C compiler and runs it against a pthread shim
  (`testdata/hostp2`). `TestOnBoard` builds the *same* table with the real
  backend and runs it on a real P2, gated on `OGO_BOARD_PORT` (`make board`).
  The second exists because flexcc and gcc have been observed to disagree on
  semantics, not just warnings -- a host-green emit feature is not verified.
- **A backend diagnostic fails the target-build tests, even when `ogo build`
  succeeds.** flexcc warns where it should refuse: given a duplicate declaration in
  one block it says `Redefining x`, ignores the second and produces a working binary
  holding the wrong value (that was `aa300e2`). So `boardBuild` treats any output
  from a *successful* build as a failure, which puts the check in `TestTargetBuild`
  -- no board needed, in the default `go test ./...`. A clean build is silent. A
  diagnostic examined and found harmless goes in the case's `backendWarning` field
  together with the reason; there is exactly one, in `empty struct type`.
- `smith` is seed-reproducible and generates compilable, self-checking programs.
  `ogo smith -seed N` emits the same program every run (the last non-determinism,
  map-iteration order in `Scope.GetSymbolsOfType`, was sorted), and `TestOracle`
  (`internal/smith/oracle_test.go`) generates a fixed seed corpus, compiles each
  to C and runs it on the host shim, so a miscompile (the program panics on a
  checksum mismatch) or a generator regression fails the test.
  **`TestGeneratorCoverage` guards the fuzzer's own blind spot:** a generator that
  produces *less* still passes `TestOracle`, which only checks that whatever was
  generated matches the VM. It asserts every construct still appears across a seed
  corpus. **Adding a construct to the generator means adding it to
  `generatedConstructs`** -- that entry is what makes its coverage tested rather
  than assumed. It catches what `staticcheck` cannot: a generator still called from
  a dispatch case whose probability range can no longer be reached. The earlier
  out-of-scope-loop-variable, bare-block and `panic` gaps that kept generated
  programs from compiling are fixed, and the generator now mints unique variable
  names (a counter, not a random suffix) so it never accidentally shadows. Widen
  `oracleSeeds` to hunt for new bugs.
- **Fixed miscompile (found by the oracle):** a shadowing local whose initializer
  references the shadowed name — `var x = x + 5` with an outer `x` in scope — used
  to miscompile, because the emitter names locals verbatim so the C initializer read
  the new (uninitialized) variable instead of the outer one. `emitVarDeclInit` (and
  the array/slice copy paths) now capture the initializer into a fresh temporary
  before the same-named C variable shadows it (`initRefsName` + `newTmp`), covering
  scalar, struct, array (`var a [N]T = a`) and slice (`var xs []T = xs`) forms; see
  the two shadowing `emitRunCases`. This is a targeted capture-before-shadow, not
  the general scope-aware C-naming layer the emitter still lacks.

## Test conventions

Semantic-check tests are table-driven over `.ogo` files in
`internal/octogo/testdata`, annotated with directives read by `tests_test.go`:

- `// COMPILE` — the whole file must type-check with zero errors.
- `// ERROR <regexp>` — the *next* line must produce an error matching `<regexp>`.

`etc.go` in each package provides the `todo()`/`trc()` position-tagged debug
helpers (guarded with `//lint:ignore U1000`); prefer them for temporary tracing.

## Notes

- `specs.go`'s doc comment is the authoritative **language spec + grammar**;
  `internal/octogo/octogo.go`'s doc comment is the authoritative **compiler-internals
  design** (check phases + WPO). `web/` holds logo assets only — the landing-page
  outline that used to live there was deleted 2026-07-18 (it was a raw LLM chat
  transcript pitching a paid-license model that the BSD LICENSE and the README's
  GitHub Sponsors tiers had already superseded). (`gem.md`, the original Gemini
  design corpus, was deleted 2026-07-10; its unique, still-unreconciled bits are
  salvaged in the appendix below.)

### 1. ~~Open decision — WPO interface handling~~ — SETTLED 2026-08-03

Resolved in favour of **static vtables** (the old option C), with monomorphization
kept as a per-call-site optimization rather than a language rule. The reasoning, the
representation, and what the checker needs first are now in
`internal/octogo/octogo.go`, which was rewritten rather than amended -- it had
described option B in detail, and two documents disagreeing about a design is how
this repository has produced bugs before.

The deciding argument, worth keeping because it generalizes: the governing rule is
that what the compiler cannot **prove** safe may be rejected, and the handled set may
grow over time. Monomorphization rejects programs whose concrete types ARE provable,
because its representation cannot hold two of them -- rejecting what it can prove is
the opposite of that rule, and growing past it is not an increment but a change of
representation. So the representation must not depend on the analysis succeeding;
rejection is spent on lifetime, where proof genuinely fails.

### 2. `p2` standard library — 1:1 mapping to flexprop C intrinsics (PARTLY BUILT)

The `p2` package (resolved from the dotless import `"p2"`) is a thin, strongly-typed
wrapper over flexcc's built-in P2 intrinsics — zero runtime overhead, no custom PASM.

**It is EMBEDDED SOURCE**, like `testing`: `p2Src` in `internal/octogo/build.go`
declares every function BODYLESS (the grammar's form for a function implemented
elsewhere) and every constant, so the checker sees real signatures and a misspelt
name is caught by the compiler rather than by C. Nothing of it is emitted — it is in
`intrinsicImports`, which `reachablePackages` skips — because every declaration is
substituted at the use: a function by its C intrinsic (`p2Intrinsics`, which carries
the result C type so a uint32 one like `Rnd` prints unsigned), a constant by its
value. The constant VALUES live once, in `p2Constants`, and `p2ConstDecls` renders
the source's const block from them so the two cannot drift. Currently wired (verified on the P2 via `TestOnBoard`, and off-target
via the `testdata/hostp2` shim which now stubs these):

| OctoGo | intrinsic (→ result) | OctoGo | intrinsic (→ result) |

The package also exports the pin-configuration CONSTANTS a smart pin is brought up
with -- `p2.DAC990R3V`, `p2.DACDitherPWM`, `p2.OutputEnable` and the rest of the DAC
set, and since 2026-08-12 the ADC one that mirrors it: the input ranges `p2.ADC1X`
through `p2.ADC100X`, the sampling modes `p2.ADCSample`/`ADCSampleExt`/`ADCScope`,
and `p2.ADCGround`/`p2.ADCSupply`/`p2.ADCFloat`, the internal references a
ratiometric reading has to be scaled between -- in `p2Constants`
(`internal/octogo/emit.go`), values from flexcc's `smartpins.h`. **`ADCSample`'s X
is a sample period of 2^X clocks and is usable to 13 and no further**: measured on a
P2-EDGE the doubling is exact up to there and at 14 every reading is 0, above that
noise, whatever the Y register says. So the mode's best is ~10640 counts between the
references, a little over 13 bits. Nothing reports the overrun. They are emitted as literals, since the p2 package has no source to
define a symbol in. They exist because the hex is unforgiving in a way that looks
like working code: `_examples/gopher` was written with `0x140006`, which is the DAC
range and the mode and no OUTPUT ENABLE, and drives nothing. They work in a `const`
declaration as any package's constants do (qualifiedConst in check.go,
foldedQualifiedInt in emit.go), and a call into p2 -- like a call into any imported
package -- is checked against its signature (checkQualifiedRef -> checkArgsIn,
which resolves the parameter types in the CALLEE's scope).

The four lock entries are the P2's 16 hardware locks, the same pool the channel
runtime draws from. **`NewLock` does not report exhaustion**: after handing out
0..15 the toolchain's `_locknew` returns 15 for every further call rather than -1,
measured on a P2-EDGE (`doc/locknew-never-fails.c`). So a caller cannot detect it,
and two logically distinct locks alias -- harmless where sharing only costs
contention, as in the channel rendezvous, and a hang where a program nests two
locks it believes are independent, `_locktry` not being reentrant. There is no blocking
acquire in the hardware, so waiting is a spin on `TryLock`, which is why it is the
one intrinsic typed `bool`. They are what lets user code write a multi-producer
structure; a single-producer/single-consumer ring buffer needs no lock and already
works (verified on the board), though it leans on the backend not hoisting the
shared index out of the poll -- there is no `volatile` in the language.

A `select` waiting on a Smart Pin transpiles to a `while(1)` poll of `_pinr(pin)`,
calling `_akpin(pin)` to clear the IN flag and `_waitx(1)` to yield and avoid Hub-bus
starvation (the same loop can multiplex channels and pins).

### 3. Dropped CLI split: `compile` vs `build`

gem.md intended two backend commands: `ogo compile` (emit intermediate C + headers
only) and `ogo build` (wrap flexprop to produce the P2 binary). Current `main.go` has
only `build`. gem.md itself flagged the doubt — *"with WPO `compile` might be no
[longer] possible"* — because whole-program optimization fights per-package separate
compilation. Decide `compile`'s fate deliberately when wiring the backend.

### 4. Misc hardware / codegen intent

- **P2 budget:** 8 Cogs; 512 KB shared Hub RAM; 512 longs (2 KB) local Cog RAM per Cog.
- **Local zero-init:** Cog-stack locals are NOT auto-zeroed by C, so the emitter must
  emit an explicit `= 0` for every `var x T` without initializer (globals rely on the
  BSS segment — already covered in `specs.go`).
- **`init()` stitching:** WPO should topologically sort global-var initializers and
  concatenate all `init()` bodies into one synthesized `__octogo_init()`, injected at
  the top of the C `main()`. (This mechanism name appears only in gem.md.)
- **Translation-unit tension:** the "one directory = one package = one C translation
  unit" model may not survive WPO, whose passes cross the per-directory boundary.
  gem.md flagged this as unresolved.
